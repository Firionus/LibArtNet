# How to contribute

Great that you are here and want to help!

## Documentation

LibArtNet uses Javadoc comment blocks for documentation of the API. This should include a brief explanation of what 
classes/methods do and how to use them. You can also include the `@author`-tag if you wish.

Please don't forget to describe what values are expected by methods and what they throw (and why).

## Testing

LibArtNet uses [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) as its Java test framework. Please make sure to write useful test 
cases for code you create. This ensures reliability and integrity of the library.

## Submitting changes

When you want to submit code changes, please create a pull request including a clear list of what you changed. It would 
also be great if you could test as much as possible, the more coverage the better.

Please follow the coding conventions below and try to add clear log messages to your commits.

## Coding conventions

Nothing fancy here and you should get your head around it real quickly.

* Intend using four spaces, **not tabs**!
* Use `camelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
* Classes start with a capital letter, variables don't. Constants are in `UPPER_CASE`.
* Use lambda code whereever possible.
* Opening braces belong in the same line.

Thanks for reading!
